Portfolio Web Application

The Portfolio Web Application is an interface that allows the user to display their project work. 
The application enables the user to add or edit their project information, which is stored in a database and displayed on the homepage.

How to run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
4. Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

What I learned:

- How to create and edit a Flask-SQLAlchemy model to connect to a database.
- How to create different routes for the application.
- How to create a Homepage and Detail view.
- How to create an Add view that allows the user to add a new project.
- How to create an Edit view that allows the user to edit an existing project.
- How to create a Delete view that allows the user to delete a project.
